## Common library code for iOS projects.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal/PivotalCoreKit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal/PivotalCoreKit)

Pivotal Core Kit is a workspace which contains projects that mirror Apple's 
system frameworks.  For instance, all extensions and additions to the 
Foundation framework live in the Foundation project under the PCK workspace.
Each project has its own builds, and its own specs.

- <Framework>
  - Core: extensions for use in production code
  - SpecHelper: extenstions for use in spec code only
  - Spec: specs for the PCK extensions

# Installation
* Create a folder: `mkdir Externals` at the root of your project (if not already created)
* Inside the root of your project run: `git submodule add Externals/PivotalCoreKit`
* Init update recursively PivotalCoreKit's submodules: `cd Externals/PivotalCoreKit` and run `git superpull` 
* Inside your editor, add the folder(s) `Externals > PivotalCoreKit` if not already present
* Add the project(s) you need into the PivotalCoreKit folder for your specs target
 * e.g. UIKit.xcodeproj
* Add the corresponding StaticLib Target Dependency for your specs target
 * e.g. UIKit+PivotalSpecHelper-StaticLib(UIKit)
* Link the corresponding binary under the Link Binary With Libraries section for your specs target
 * e.g. libUIKit+PivotalSpecHelper-StaticLib.a
* Update your Header Search Paths to include the path to the necessary PCK headers for your specs target
 * e.g."$(PROJECT_DIR)/Externals/PivotalCoreKit" and make it recursive 

# Library Documentation

## UIKit
### SpecHelpers

you can include all the UI spec helpers:

	#include "UIKit+PivotalSpecHelpers.h"
	
or individually include the ones you want to use:

	#include "UITabBarController+Spec.h"

#### UIKit+PivotalSpecHelpers.h
this header includes the following UI extensions
#### UITabBarController+Spec.h
	- (void)tapTabAtIndex:(NSUInteger)position;

Simulates tapping a tab bar at index.  This will raise an assertion error if the index it out of bounds of the tabs. If the UITabBarController instance has a delegate it will test the -tabBarController:shouldSelectViewController: method and only select the tab based on the results.
