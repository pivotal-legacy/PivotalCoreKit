# PivotalCoreKit â€” Common library code for iOS projects.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal/PivotalCoreKit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal/PivotalCoreKit)

## Why PivotalCoreKit
PivotalCoreKit lets you keep creating beautiful apps without having to rewrite the same boilerplate code in every project.

While it has useful functionality in a few different domains, it has a particular focus on helping developers test drive their iOS applications.

## What can PivotalCoreKit help with

### Highlights
* Method swizzling
* Collect/map an NSArray
* Resize a UIImage with aspect fit or aspect fill
* Simulate taps on UIButtons
* Simulate UIGestureRecognizer recognition
* Compare two UIImages for equality
* Query and inspect current UIActionSheet and UIAlertView
* Stub out NSOperationQueue and run its operations on demand
* Stub out NSURLConnection to simulate network activity and callbacks
* Stub out UIWebView's functionality

### Full list
PivotalCoreKit is split along framework lines, with separate Xcode projects for the Foundation, UIKit, and CoreLocation frameworks. Each project is then separated again out into sub-sections: Core, SpecHelper, and SpecHelperStubs. 

**Core** methods are meant to be used anywhere they're useful, whether in specs or in the primary application.  
**SpecHelper** extends built-in classes to make testing easier and more seemless.  
**SpecHelperStubs** stub out (and replace) a class's functionality to allow a developer to more easily inspect its state.

Here is a (hopefully exhaustive but inevitably out of date) list of PivotalCoreKit functionality, separated by framework/section:

* Foundation
  * Core
    * Convert NSString into a SHA1 hash (as NSData)
    * Convert NSData into a hexadecimal string
    * Method redirection on NSObjects (also commonly called Swizzling)
    * Convert an NSString ("Hello world I am doing great today") into camel case ("HelloWorldIAmDoingGreatToday")
    * Check if an NSString is blank
    * Check if an NSString is a valid email address
    * Percent escape encode an NSString including characters the build-in percent escaping doesn't include.
    * Map an NSArray into another NSArray by collecting items through a block
    * Convert an NSDictionary into a string of query parameters
    * NSURLConnectionDelegate based networking service (PCKHTTPConnection and PCKHTTPInterface)
    * An event-driven XML parser (PCKParser)
  * SpecHelper
    * Break out query parameters of an NSURL into an NSDictionary
    * Fake out NSURLConnection to keep it from actually accessing network and fire success/failure responses on demand
    * Return the body of an NSURLRequest as a string
    * Fake out +[NSUUID UUID] to return consistent results
    * Fake out NSOperationQueue to execute blocks on demand
* UIKit
  * Core
    * Produce a UIBarButtonItem from a UIButton
    * Resize a UIImage with aspect fill or aspect fit
    * Crop a UIImage or add rounded corners
    * Translating UIViews by deltas
    * Resizing UIViews with corner pinning
    * Calculate accurate height from NSString and NSAttributedString drawing
  * SpecHelper
    * Simulate a tap on 
      * UIButton
      * UITableViewCell
      * UICollectionViewCell
      * UIBarButtonItem
      * UITabBarController item
    * Simulate a tap, swipe, or pinch on a UIView (triggers attached gesture recognizers)
    * Simulate a new value for a UISlider
    * Simulate recognition of specific gesture recognizer
    * Compare UIImages for equality 
    * Query a UIWindow for the first responder
  * SpecHelperStubs
    * Query, inspect, and simulate taps on the current UIActionSheet
    * Query, inspect, and simulate taps on the current UIAlertView
    * Simulate availability states of UIImagePickerController (camera available/not available, et cetera)
    * Inspect arguments (duration, delay, options) on last UIView animation
    * Fake out UIWebView to inspect requests, simulate back/forward state, and simulate web loads
* CoreLocation
  * SpecHelper
    * Simulate Geocoding success or failure

PivotalCoreKit is test-driven and includes Specs in each project.

## That sounds great, give me some examples

Maybe you have a bunch of quarterly reports and want to collect all the finances from the first week for each report.  
After linking to **Foundation+PivotalCore**
```objc
#import "NSArray+PivotalCore.h"
/* ... */
Week week = FirstWeek;
NSArray *firstWeekFinances = [reports collect:^id(PLReport *report) {
    return [report financesForWeek:week];
}];
```

Or maybe you're testing that tapping a button properly fires off a network request  
After linking to **UIKit+PivotalSpecHelper**  
```objc
#import "UIControl+Spec.h"
/* ... */
describe(@"when the button is tapped", ^{
    beforeEach(^{
        [button tap];
    });

    it(@"fires a network request", ^{
        apiClient should have_received(@selector(requestNewestRecipes));
    });
});
```

Say you want to check what URL a webview was asked to load.
After linking to **UIKit+PivotalSpecHelperStubs**
```objc
#import "UIWebView+Spec.h"
/* ... */
it(@"webview should load example.com", ^{
    controller.webView.request.URL.absoluteString should equal(@"http://example.com");
});
```
Without PivotalCoreKit's UIWebView stubs, the webView's NSURLRequest will be nil because the real UIWebView hasn't started actually making the request. A stubbed UIWebView updates the request property immediately.

## How do I install PivotalCoreKit
* In a shell in the root of your project run: `git submodule add git@github.com:pivotal/PivotalCoreKit.git Externals/PivotalCoreKit`
* Add the PivotalCoreKit project(s) (Foundation.xcodeproj, UIKit.xcodeproj, or CoreLocation.xcodeproj) you need into your project for the appropriate target
* In your application's Project Settings, under Build Phases, add the desired StaticLib to "Target Dependencies"
* Add the corresponding binary to the Link Binary With Libraries section
* Switch to Build Settings and update your Header Search Paths to include the path to folder containing the added subproject. Make it recursive.
 * e.g. "$(SRCROOT)/Externals/PivotalCoreKit/path/to/specific/projectfolder/". 

### Example, adding -[UIButton tap] to a spec target
* `git submodule add git@github.com:pivotal/PivotalCoreKit.git Externals/PivotalCoreKit`
* Right-click Specs folder in Xcode -> Add Files
* Navigate into PivotalCoreKit/UIKit folder, select UIKit.xcodeproj and add.
* In root project file, choose Specs target
* Under the "Build Phases" tab along the top of the project settings, add UIKit+PivotalSpecHelper-StaticLib to "Target Dependencies"
* Add libUIKit+PivotalSpecHelper-StaticLib.a to the "Link Binary With Library" section
* Switch to the "Build Settings" tab Add "$(SRCROOT)/Externals/PivotalCoreKit/UIKit/" to "Header Search Paths" and make it recursive
* In the desired spec file, add #import "UIControl+Spec.h" and freely use [button tap];
